Galleria is a movie website that I developed using a variety of technologies. The website utilizes TmDB API to display an extensive selection of movies and TV shows, which can be searched and filtered according to the user's preferences.

One of the key features of Galleria is its filtering system, which allows users to browse and select their preferred content based on genre. The filter function was built using Javascript, React, CSS, and Bootstrap, enabling users to search and sort the available movies and TV shows with ease.

Additionally, I used a range of technologies to build the website's front-end and back-end functionality. The front-end was developed using React, a popular and flexible Javascript library that allows for dynamic and responsive UI design. I also used CSS and Bootstrap to ensure that the website is visually appealing and user-friendly.

The back-end functionality of the website was built using Node.js and Express, providing a reliable and scalable foundation for the API to run on. I used MongoDB to store and manage the data for the website, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date and accurate.

Overall, Galleria was a challenging and rewarding project to work on. The use of TmDB API and the integration of filtering functionality required careful planning and attention to detail. However, the end result was a sleek, user-friendly website that enables users to easily find and watch their favorite movies and TV shows.
